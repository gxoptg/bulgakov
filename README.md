# Bulgakov

*Write your blog like a master*

This is a simple blog engine. It's not dedicated to everyone because it's built upon `Node.js` and `Mongo DB`, which aren't easily accessible on any hosting. However, it features simple, uncluttered design both for a reader and a writer and makes it much easier to share your thoughts.
